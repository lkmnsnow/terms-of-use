TERMS OF USE
Last Updated: 12 January 2026

1. Service Description
MyBizzCard provides business card scanning and management features using offline OCR and optional AI-assisted recognition.

2. Accuracy Disclaimer
OCR and AI results may be inaccurate. You are responsible for verifying all scanned information before saving, sharing, or using it.

3. Permission and Compliance
You must have permission to scan, store, or export another person’s contact details. You are responsible for compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

4. AI Processing
Some features use AI-powered extraction. When AI is used, the App securely sends either OCR text extracted on your device or a card image (depending on the feature and mode) for recognition.
We do not store business card images, OCR text, or extracted contact data on our servers.

5. Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, MyBizzCard is not liable for damages arising from misuse, inaccurate recognition, or unauthorized use of scanned data.

6. Subscriptions
Paid subscriptions are handled by Google Play. You can manage or cancel subscriptions through Google Play settings.

7. Changes
We may update these Terms of Use from time to time. Continued use of the App means you accept the updated Terms.
